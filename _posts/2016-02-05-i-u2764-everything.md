After [@_LovedArt](/i-u2764-everyone/) was banned yesterday for sending Twitter users love directly, I still had lots of love to share. So I decided to declare my love for all the hashtags on Twitter instead.

[@_lovedHArt][_lovedhart] is a Twitter bot that picks a random hashtag and declares, "I ❤️ #TOPIC", once every five minutes. The bot maintains history so as to only love each topic once. [See the bot in action over @_lovedHArt][_lovedhart]

[Source code and instructions for running the bot are on Github][src].

### Why?
Social media engagement.

### Does the bot discriminate?
@_lovedHArt loves everything equally. It unconditionally loves and whole heartedly supports each topic for five minutes, before moving on and never mentioning that topic again.

### Isn't this still spam?
No. What company doesn't want their lame #campaign loved? What #movement would turn down another supporter? And what lowly user would not smile to see their forced new #meme get some much deserved attention?
