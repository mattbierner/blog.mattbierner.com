After watching the 1987 film *Aerobicide* (aka *Killer Workout*), I was so inspired that I letterpressed a poster for it.

The poster was printed on a Vandercook proofing press at Seattle's [School of Visual Concepts](https://www.svcseattle.com). The forms for each of the four colors was laser cut and pressure printed, while the text at the bottom is wood type.

This was my second attempt at [pressure printing](https://letterpresscommons.com/pressure-printing/), the first being the [DNA Print poster](/dna-print-open-house). Pressure printing is a fun technique because you can easily print larger sizes prints using only paper, an x-acto (or laser cutter), and a glue sticks. It also produces pretty nice results.

The end result turned out rather different than what I had originally designed on the computer, but that's what keeps letterpress interesting (at least if you are not very good like yours truly.) It does look a little better in person too; photographing it was difficult.

Now if the poster has perchance piqued your curiosity in the film, be aware that, while I found the film to be a revelation, truly appreciating it does require a certain refinement of pop cultural sensibility. For while *Aerobicide* is perhaps lacking in plot and character development, and while perhaps a quarter of it is footage of women in leotards working out to SynthPop, and even though it perhaps may not be that great of a slasher film when judged by slasher film standards—which is to say: that while the movie is not a good movie in just about any objective sense—I'm telling you, when I watched it there at one in the morning in that unheated warehouse while [printing the human genome](/dna-print), as those synths got pumping and Donna De Lory started belting [*Only You Tonight*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY23oOKC9x8), I knew nirvana.
