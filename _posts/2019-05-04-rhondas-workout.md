So I letterpressed [another](/aerobicide-print) *Aerobicide* poster. Look: it's not like this is an obsession or anything. I can stop anytime I want too, it's just that I got this hot pink paper that was just screaming out for some zebra print... Plus, printing on pink paper was an interesting challenge.

The posters are 12x17 and were printed using a big lino block plus wood type. The zebra print was printed twice with the two colors slightly offset, giving a faux 3D look. Because the paper was so vibrant, I had to underprint the colors with white to get even somewhat reasonable colors, although they are somewhat darker than I hoped.

Maybe I'll paste some up around Seattle sometime. The world needs to know about Rhonda's Workout after all.
