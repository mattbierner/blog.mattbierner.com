*Keep on HustliN'* is a website that plays Van McCoy's *Keep on Hustlin'* whenever someone uses the word "hustle" on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).

While for some the word *hustle* may recall summer afternoons spent chasing the ol' pig skin, and while others may associate *hustling* with the famed Wall Street furry-fests of the late 1980s, the image the word brings to my mind is decidedly less positive. To me, *hustle* suggests something slimy, slightly devious and underhanded. Dirty. And a hustle is small. It is not a heist or a scheme or a swindle, rather it is altogether pathetic when dragged out in the light. Shady salesmen, pickup artists, Martin Shkreli; those are people who hustle.

So when I come across articles with titles like "How we hustled our way to mega spondulix in 12 days" or see phrases like "side-hustle," I can't help but cringe a little. Because hustling is not something to strive for; it's not something to celebrate. And so I decided to turn the negative experience of seeing all this hustle flaunting into the positive experience of Van McCoy's *Keep on Hustlin'*. Can't go wrong with McCoy. And now I can't help but smile a little whenever I come across such hustlage.

But what of this other H word: hacker? Don't aspects of hacking—and specifically growth hacking—fall under what you may term a *hustle*? True, but I think there is an important distinction. A hacker works outside the system, exploiting it in order to achieve their own goals, be it profit or just having fun. A hustler on the other hand is a product of the system. They work within it to achieve the goals that the system set out for them. 

A fair number of people on hacker news seem to share my dislike of "hustling", with many of the mentions of the word actually railing against it. Indeed the [most hustly post thus far](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14908034) is a definition of the word itself. Most HN. Thankfully, it also seems that we've hit peak hustle, with the number of "hustles" per month saying flat or even declining since 2011:

This means that you may have to keep *Keep on HustliN'* open for a while in order to experience an organic HN hustle. Therefore, I recommend trying out *[Keep on Hustlin' Forever][forever]*. It operates under the theory that if one rendition of *Keep on Hustlin'* is good, than 30 renditions of *Keep on Hustlin'* at the same time must be better. The resulting auditory experience grows oddly compelling after ten minutes or so.
