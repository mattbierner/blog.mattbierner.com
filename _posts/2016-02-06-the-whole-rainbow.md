**Update 2** -  Confirmed: Instagram hates rainbows. The script mysteriously stops and starts working, with the uploads succeeding but the images being insta deleted. Switched over the [Twitter @wholerainbow](https://twitter.com/wholerainbow) instead since their public API is not so intentionally crippled. You can find the original Instagram logic in the [Instagram code branch](https://github.com/mattbierner/The-Whole-Rainbow/tree/instagram).

**Update** - Now continuing work at [@thewholerainbow2][wholerainbow2] since the original mysteriously stopped working.

***

[@wholerainbow][wholerainbow] is an <strike>Instagram</strike> Twitter account that posts an image of a new solid color every five minutes, slowly working its way through all 16,777,216 24bit RGB colors.

{% include image.html file="example.png" %}

It should finish sometime in the 2170s, but we'll all be dead by then. You will never see the whole rainbow, but you may make it to around #888888 if you're lucky.

If you notice that @thewholerainbow has stopped uploading, feel free to use the [source code from github][src] to continue its mission.
