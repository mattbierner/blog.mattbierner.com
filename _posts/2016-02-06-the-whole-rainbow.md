[@thewholerainbow][wholerainbow] is an Instagram account that posts an image of a new solid color every five minutes, slowly working its way through all 16,777,216 24bit RGB colors. (**update** - now continuing work at [@thewholerainbow2][wholerainbow2] since the original mysteriously stopped working)

{% include image.html file="example.png" %}

It should finish sometime in the 2170s, but we'll all be dead by then. You will never see the whole rainbow, but you may make it to around #888888 if you're lucky.

Instagram does not provide official API support for uploads, but I've made the [source code for running @thewholerainbow available on github][src]. If you notice that @thewholerainbow has stopped uploading, feel free to use the scripts to continue its mission. The uploads are also tagged with `#whole🌈`, `#HEX_COLOR` so you can easily track what has been uploaded so far instead of starting from scratch.
