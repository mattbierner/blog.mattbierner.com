Conceptual conceptual art is the art of ideas. Conceptual conceptual art pieces exist only within the mind of the artist, free from the tyranny of craft, from the bounds of material, and from the degrading pressure of exhibition, giving artists a profound new freedom to explore the human condition and comment on the role of art in the modern world.

This video profiles a conceptual conceptual artist in their studio, and spotlights a few of their works.
