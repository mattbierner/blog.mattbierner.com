Next weekend is your one and only chance to experience the [human genome printed on paper tape][src] in person! 

## Key Information

**When?**

March 17th. One to five PM.

**Where?**

[14007 Lake City Way](https://goo.gl/maps/SEutWJkggcp) in Seattle.

**Cost?**

Free!

**What?**

The *DNA Print* project is an attempt to print human genome on paper tape. See the [project overview][src] more information.

The two punches have been running off-and-on for a few weeks now, and we've printed at a little over 1% of the human genome. There's been good progress on chromosome's one and four, plus some initial work on X.

As for the event itself, there's going to be piles of paper tape you can look at and take photos of. The punches will be running too, which should be quite thrilling. All in all, it's probably the most exciting way to spend your Saint Patrick's day.

**Getting there**

Follow directions to [14007 Lake City Way](https://goo.gl/maps/SEutWJkggcp). Look for the sign that says: "Lake City Auto Rebuild". The building itself looks like this:

You can park in front of the building or along the street next to it.

Look for the door with the 14007 above it. If it isn't open, there will be a phone number posted that you can call or text to get let in.

**Gift shop**

After five, all the paper tape is up for grabs. Bring a contractor bag.

<!-- There were originally going to be two open houses but I got sick for the first one (which may or may not have had something to do with the aforementioned unheated warehouse filled with paper dust). Besides I had to finish the letterpress poster for the event. -->
