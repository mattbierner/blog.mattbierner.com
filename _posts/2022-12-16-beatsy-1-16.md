With this update, we're exploring a new style of visualizer that distorts geometric shapes. The two new additions are:

- The *Capsule* visualizer stretches out and distorts a sphere using sound waves.

- The *Ferro Sphere* visualizer creates bumps on a sphere that react to sound or your music. This one was inspired by [magnetic fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid), similar to the original *Ferro* effect. 

You can customize the colors of both new effects.

The latest update is [available for free in the App Store][beatsy]. Looking forward to seeing what you all create using these two new effects!
