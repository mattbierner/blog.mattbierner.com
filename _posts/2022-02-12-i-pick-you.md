When a musician called [Big Chungus][chungus] contacted me about making an augmented reality experience for Beatsy, I wasn't quite sure what to make of him. But then he started talking about giant noses bleeding candy hearts and I knew we had to make this thing happen.

So just in time for Valentine's Day, here's the new "I Pick You" musical experience for Beatsy! You can try it in the [full app][beatsy] under "clips" or by [visiting this link][clip] on an iOS device (it's an App Clip so you don't even need to install anything).

The effect features a pulsating golden nose, a swirl of candy hearts, a violent [nosebleed](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoseBleed), sentiently lyrics, and a slowly expanding pool of blood. In other words: the perfect Valentines Day!

The pool of blood is the most interesting technical part of the experience. It's only available on devices with a LiDAR sensor (iPhone 12/13 Pro, or iPad Pro) since the pool tries to conform to whatever geometry the nose is placed above.

This was certainly a fun effect to create and I'm looking forward to working on more of these little AR music video type experience in the future. If you're a musician and are interested in showcasing your work with Beatsy, [get in touch](https://rarerealities.com/about).
