"Get of my lawn!", he blogged snidely.

[There Is No I In Internet][src] is a Chrome extension that automatically rewrites text to just personal pronouns (I, me, myself, us, we), personal possessives (my, mine), and the names of a few popular social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram). All non-whitelisted words are replaced with underscore.

The results can be rather entertaining. 


#### Before
{% include image.html file="before.png" %}

#### After 
{% include image.html file="after.png" %}


You can also whitelist your own words (such as your name or the name of that [hot new social network](https://blot.re)) and disable the extension for specific sites.

Check out the [website][src] for a few more details or download the extension from the [Chrome web store][store].
